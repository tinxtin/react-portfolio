                Based in Brighton, United Kingdom. My coding journey began in 2022; I started learning basic concepts through
                free online courses and Youtube videos. Fast-forwards to now, and I've worked on couple of exciting personal projects.

                My main focus now days is to work as UI/UX designer & web developer. Creating intuitive, accessible and immersive interface
                for the digital experience.
